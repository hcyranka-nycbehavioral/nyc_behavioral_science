Notes about migration pattterns:


##Total out migration from NYC to other states

1 - Most migration goes to either NY or neighboring states (especially NJ).
2 - Removing neighboring states, we start to see the importance of Florida

##The "March to the South" from NYC is clearer when we look at net migration:

If we exclude neighboring states and internal movements, the top 5 states are:
	- Florida
	- California (This one is interesting)
	- North Carolina
	- Georgia
	- Texas

	- And the net migration from Florida is twice as large as it is from California

Where do people go in Florida?
	 - Miami-Dade County, mostly
	 - If we aggregate the data by Media Market, over 50% of migration from NYC to 
	 Florida is concentrated in Miami and the Orlando media markets.
	 - The map makes it even clearer

Open questions:

- What are the consequences? Can we bring these people back?
- The data (collected and estimated before Covid) suggest that migration to Florida (and to the South) was already under way.

Edits December 24:

- If we look at the national map, we see that the movement to places like Georgia, Florida, and
North Carolina is usually concentrated along the coast? 
- Maybe we talking about snow birds that are making their residency there permanently?
- In terms of migration to NY, we have some interesting movement from New England and in some border counties.
The map is an indicator only, but what could that mean?

- Looking at net migration by Media Market (which should give us roughly the data by city/metro area), it provides a somewhat interesting picture. Internal migration still reigns, but we see movements to places in Pennsylvania, upstate, but also a lot of places in the south.
	- What if NY is losing people in general, not only to other states, but to other metro areas?


- Also, I analyzed by Media Market the total flow from NY divided by Total Flow to NY for each DMA. This generates an index.
If we filter out the small flows (I am putting a floor of 1,000), and arrange the data, i think this generates an interesting data point: 
	- While the total flow in absolute numbers is not that large, NY sends 5 more times more people to Fort Myers, Florida
	than it receives from the same area.
	- Similar thing with Charlotte, NC: The flow from NY is 4 times greater than the flow to NY.
