Notes about migration pattterns:


##Total out migration from NYC to other states

1 - Most migration goes to either NY or neighboring states (especially NJ).
2 - Removing neighboring states, we start to see the importance of Florida

##The "March to the South" from NYC is clearer when we look at net migration:

If we exclude neighboring states and internal movements, the top 5 states are:
	- Florida
	- California (This one is interesting)
	- North Carolina
	- Georgia
	- Texas

	- And the net migration from Florida is twice as large as it is from California

Where do people go in Florida?
	 - Miami-Dade County, mostly
	 - If we aggregate the data by Media Market, over 50% of migration from NYC to 
	 Florida is concentrated in Miami and the Orlando media markets.
	 - The map makes it even clearer

Open questions:

- What are the consequences? Can we bring these people back?
- The data (collected and estimated before Covid) suggest that migration to Florida (and to the South) was already under way.
